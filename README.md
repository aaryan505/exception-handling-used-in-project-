# Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This Python script converts a given word into its phonetic alphabet representation using the NATO phonetic alphabet.

## Script Overview

The script reads a CSV file (`nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`) containing the NATO phonetic alphabet and creates a dictionary mapping letters to their phonetic codes. It then prompts the user to enter a word and converts it into its phonetic representation.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is a programming concept used to manage errors and unexpected situations gracefully. In this script, exception handling is employed to deal with invalid user inputs. Here’s how it works:

### **Try-Except Block**

- **Try Block:** The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. In this script, it attempts to generate a phonetic representation for each letter in the user’s input.
- **Except Block:** If a `KeyError` occurs (which happens if the input contains characters not present in the phonetic dictionary), the `except` block catches this exception. It prints an error message and recursively calls the `generate_phonetic()` function to prompt the user to try again.

### **Why Use Exception Handling?**

- **Graceful Error Management:** It allows the program to handle errors without crashing, providing a user-friendly error message instead.
- **User Input Validation:** It ensures that the user can only input valid characters, making the script more robust and reliable.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python phonetic_converter.py
